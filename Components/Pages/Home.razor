                    Getting into speedrunning is harder than it needs to be.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Not because running a game is hard, but because the setup info is a mess.
                    You end up bouncing between Discords, half-updated docs, speedrun.com pages,
                    old Reddit posts, and YouTube videos that skip the bit you actually needed.

                <p>
                    Everyone in the community knows this stuff already, so it rarely gets written
                    down in one clean place. If you’re new, you don’t even know what questions to ask,
                    you just know something isn’t working.

                <p class="muted">
                    Downpatch exists to smooth that first step. It pulls together the boring but important
                    setup details, then points you to the real guides and communities once you’re unblocked.

            <section class="home-section" aria-labelledby="start">
                <h2 id="start" class="home-h2 home-kicker2">A simple way to start</h2>

                <p class="home-lead2">
                    You don’t need to learn everything up front. You just need enough to get a run recorded properly and not
                    get caught out by some weird version thing.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The general flow is: pick a game, check what timing method it uses, get LiveSplit set up in a normal way,
                    and only then worry about downpatching if the category actually needs it. That’s it really.
                </p>

                <p class="muted">
                    The guides should be short and practical. If you’re reading a wall of text and still don’t know what to do,
                    that page needs fixing.

                <h2 id="what-youll-find" class="home-h2 home-kicker2">What the game pages actually cover</h2>

                <p>
                    Each game page is meant to answer the “okay but what do I actually do” questions. Stuff like:
                </p>

                <p class="muted">
                    What timing method the game uses (and what that means in practice), any common settings people forget,
                    what version is expected for popular categories, and whether downpatching is a thing for that game at all.
                </p>

                <p>
                    If a game has a proper community guide, Downpatch should just link you straight to it. If the community has
                    a Discord with a good pinned setup message, same thing. The goal is to get you to the right place quickly,
                    not keep you on this site.

                <p>
                    This is not a leaderboard, and it’s not trying to be one. It’s also not a replacement for game communities,
                    and it’s definitely not a rules authority.
                </p>

                <p class="muted">
                    If something here disagrees with the game’s community rules / speedrun.com page, assume the community is right.
                    The point is to reduce confusion, not create a new source of arguments.

                    This will keep changing. Tools change, versions change, and explanations can always be cleaner.

                    If something feels unclear or awkward, it probably needs rewriting. Even small “this bit confused me” feedback
                    is useful.
