            A source of truth for getting started with speedrunning.
            Clear, game-by-game guidance on timing methods, LiveSplit setup,
            whether you need to downpatch, where to buy the game,
            and links to trusted community resources.
        </p>
        <p class="hint">
            The aim is to make the first step predictable, then point you towards
            the best guides and communities for the game you want to run.
