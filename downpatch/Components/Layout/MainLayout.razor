            A source of truth for getting started with speedrunning.
            Clear, game-by-game guidance on timing methods, LiveSplit setup,
            whether you need to downpatch, where to buy the game,
            and links to trusted community resources.

            The aim is to make the first step predictable, then point you towards
            the best guides and communities for the game you want to run.
